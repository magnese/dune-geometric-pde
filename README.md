dune-geometric-pde
==================

[dune-geometric-pde][0] is a [Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment][1]
module which implements a parametric finite element scheme to solve the mean
curvature flow and the surface diffusion problem in 2D and 3D domains.

A detailed description of this method can be found in the PhD thesis

[Front tracking finite element methods for two-phase Navier--Stokes flow, 
1 February 2018, Imperial College London, London, UK.][2]
