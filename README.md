dune-geometric-pde
==================

[dune-geometric-pde][0] is a [Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment][1]
module which implements a parametric finite element scheme to solve the mean
curvature flow and the surface diffusion problem in 2D and 3D domains.

It is based on the scheme described in the paper

[J.W.#Barrett, H.~Garcke and R.~N\"urnberg: A parametric finite element method
for fourth order geometric evolution equations, J. Comput. Phys. 222 (2007),
441--467.][2]
